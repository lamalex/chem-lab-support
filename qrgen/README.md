## A really simple qrcode generator

My partner was sketched out by free online QR generator websites, and she wanted to generate QR code for a report she was distributing to her colleagues. I built her this live-updating QR generator in ~20 minutes and it lives on my raspberry pi.

If you have need for this you can from the project directory, run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Enjoy.
